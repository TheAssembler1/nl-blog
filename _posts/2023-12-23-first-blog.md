## About Me

I am currently entering my last semester at Louisiana State University (LSU). I should receive a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics by the end of May 2024 ðŸ¤ž.

Just to give you a sense of my experience, here is a brief overview of what I have done:

* *Cloud Computing Engineer* (LSU Distributed Systems Research): Jan. 2023 - Dec. 2023
* *Cloud Computing Engineer* (LSU IoT/Physiological Research): Aug. 2023 - Dec. 2023
* *C#/.NET Associate Developer* (Rural Sourcing): Aug. 2022 - Oct. 2023
* *Backend Engineer (Vigilus)*: Jan. 2023 - Dec. 2023

## Current Research

I have recently started working with Suren Byna, whose personal website you may find [here](https://sbyna.github.io/). My work will involve the optimization of I/O on HPC systems. It is very exciting stuff, and I cannot wait to get started! Starting in early January 2024, I will begin work on a survey paper regarding the topic **ML I/O Access Patterns**. As I read through papers on the subject, I plan on blogging about my findings here. So, if you are interested, feel free to stick around ðŸ˜„.

## Future Plans

I have already submitted my application to join Ohio State University (OSU) for the Autumn 2024 semester. I feel confident I will be accepted because I am already beginning work with my potential advisor and meet all the minimum requirements of the program. Currently, I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, so the change in location will be an exciting one.
